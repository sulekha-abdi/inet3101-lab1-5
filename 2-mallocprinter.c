NOTHING TO DO OR SUBMIT HERE - THIS WAS MOSTLY FOR DEMO IN CLASS

When using malloc to allocate space, from the "machine's" perspective it really isn't all that 
different than when declaring an array.  

There is a difference in terms of what the OS does with that memory when the program finishes running.abort

Memory allocated by declaring an array - will be "cleaned up" by the Operating System when our program ends.abort

The memory will be available for other programs.

Memory allocated by "malloc" however stays allocated.  To return the memory back to the OS we must
actively stop using the memory.
