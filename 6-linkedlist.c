// Example of using a Link List to manage a List of Data.  You cannot use a Linked List in Lab 2.  You have to use dynamic memory
// Why all these different data structures and approaches? Computing has been around for a long time and there are lots of options and approaches.
// I don't really see why anyone would use a Linked List anymore.
// This is the kind of thing that Python for example hoped to address.  Java, C# all have hundreds of different data structures/collection types.
// Python's contention "ya but don't like 3 or 4 of them kind of cover most uses?"

// I couldn't find my old examples from when I taught Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Algorithms & Data Structures at another institution
// (remember I don't have a comp sci degree....Electronics Engineering undergrad. I do have a Masters in Software Engineering - but that's a completely different discipline)

// I tried out CoPilot AI to generate this code.
// See if you can:
// A. Understand it (you SHOULD if you took algorithms and data structures)
// B. Make it rue
// C. Ponder why this kinda solves some of the same problems we're trying to solve using dynamic memory
